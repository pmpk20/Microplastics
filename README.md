# Microplastics
All data, code, and outputs for the microplastics individual option prices paper.


Description: 
- The anonymised survey data has 1564 obs.
- Execute 00_Microplastics_Replicator.R to create all the outputs in the paper
- Files are numbered in order of execution
- Models executed with 10,000 bootstrap replicates so computationally intensive
- Most model outputs now uploaded, let me know if anything is missing.
- GLM reports positive log-likelihood and negative AIC, we flip those signs in outputs.
- Using specialist and High-Performance Computing systems provided by Information Services at the University of Kent, and by the Research Computing Team at the University of Leeds.
- Using RStudio and Apollo (Hess and Palma, 2019).
- This work was funded by DEFRA.
